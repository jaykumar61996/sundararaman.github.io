# Surround AI
Surround AI is the python framework which is designed for flexible usage in Artificial Intelligence(AI). It consist of several machine learning pipeline.

**Why surround?**
* It is designed to support data scientist in their progress.
*  Each and every scientist use different algorithm to solve different problems. There are no standard way for them to analyse altogether in a single module.
*   To provide a standard solution surround framework is built. 
* Each and every machine learning pipeline can be accessed for getting the appropriate solution instead of reffering many machine learning packages.
# Usage
* Helping the data scientists in analytics instead            
using glue codes for their research.
*  Easy interaction between several machine learning pipelines.
* Provides end-to-end solution instead of providing solution for the models.
# Current
Using cloud API for training models for image recognition.
Developing a pipeline for the surround module using machine learning algorithms.
# Eagle Eye
## Aim
To identify the drivers who are breaking the road rules with the help of AI(Artificial Intelligence).
**(Note: The system pipeline for this app is strictly under development.)**
## Method

* Taking the photo of the car on the mobile application
*  Storing the image for the process.
*  Sending the notification to the authorities API (note: Check the availability of the access to API)
* Integrating with AWSâ€™s recognition API for reading car number plates.
*  Again notifies the Authorities for the infringement notice.
## Installation guide:
**Windows:**
* Clone the surround repository.
*  Install python 3.6.5.
* Set path in Environment variables for python 3.6.5.
* Type !pip3 install surround in command prompt to install surround in your system.
# Conclusion:
Surround is under development which as goals to satisfy the needs of data scientists. It completely turns the view of analysing in machine learning and other concepts of AI(Artificial Intelligence).
